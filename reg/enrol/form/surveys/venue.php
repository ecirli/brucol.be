   Update in the Conference Venue
</h2>
   Dear colleague <?php echo __ucwords($data['name_surname']) ?></b>,
<br>
While we have posted this information on the event website, being honest and sincere to our participants, we found necessary to provide the same via email .<br>
As you have remarked in your final acceptance letter, the '.gc('conf_name_shortest').' conference venue has been updated to be at "Mercure Paris Centre Eiffel Tower" instead of at the premises of Sorbonne University<br>
where it was intially arranged on the basis of a signed convention. Unfortunately this venue can not be available due to internal reasons of the university.<br>As you could see in our archive for the former 15 editions of ICSS,<br>
we have never changed a venue from the one that was initiallly announced.<br>We apologize for this, which was beyond our control.<br>
However, we have taken initiation by signing another convention with "Mercure Paris Centre Eiffel Tower" and paid for all the upcoming services in advance to secure a good organization.<br> 
This location has many advantages as well. It is a 4 star hotel. The coctails, coffee and lunch services will be in high standard. It is very much central, just about 300 m to Eiffel Tower!<br>
        
At this point, we hope that you would understand and cooperate with us to complete the organization as a successful academic meeting.<br>

However, we are ready to coopearate as well to make a full refund and cancel your registration without any hesitation, in case you decide so.<br>
